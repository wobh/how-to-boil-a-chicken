* Introduction

This is a lightning talk I gave at [[http://www.portlandcodeschool.com][Portland Code School]] as an exercise
in ignite presentations in [[https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/][impress.js]]. I very crudely adapted the
sample code to my needs, and brutally ripped out anything fancy. Since
then, I have, in the manner of the fabled Procrustes, stuffed the
presentation into a [[http://middlemanapp.com/][Middleman]] app.

But that is nothing compared to the fate of the chicken.

* Ingredients

- 1 chicken 13-16 lbs, beheaded, befooted, and befeathered, but
  otherwise whole
- 1 gallon +/- water
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1, 1 inch ginger, skinned
- 5, cloves of garlic, whole
- 1 tablespoon of dried thyme

* Instructions

1. Put chicken in large pot, with organs if available.
2. Cover chicken with water (may boil water).
3. Add other ingredients.
4. Bring water to boil, simmer for 4ish hours.
5. Separate the meat from the bones. Break the large bones and soak
   in broth.
6. Strain the broth from the remains of the chicken and vegetables.
7. Add back to the broth, some of the vegetable remains (especially the garlic)
   back to the broth
8. Add back to the broth, some of the fatty bits of chicken remains, also the cartilege
   and joint tissue.
9. Blend and dillute broth as necessary.

* Notes on slides

1. Warning: presentation contains animal viscera.
2. Water down your broth. It's quite rich, and could probably be doubled.
5. "Whole" chicken
6. Remove pad, rip paper and put guts in pot. We throw away the guts
   afterwards. "You're welcome, raccoons."
10. Warning: Water 200℉
11 – 12. Use two forks like tossing a salad
14. Separating meat from bones.
17. Breaking bones to add back to pot
19. 1.5 Quart bowl

- After simmering, you should try to do the steps of separating meat
  and broth as quickly as possible. It usually takes me a about a half
  hour, but I'm trying to get that down.
